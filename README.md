# Carvana_LGBM
For my "intro to business statistics" course in my MBA, we broke up into teams and competed in this Carvana case.
But unlike my classmates, I have a technical background so I approached prediction with machine learning instead of "intuition."
Turns out, an LGBM model is much better at prediction than business intuition lol.

Needless to say, my team took home 1st place. I was also asked to TA the course next year.
